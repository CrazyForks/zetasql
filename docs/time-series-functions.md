### `DATE_BUCKET`

```sql
DATE_BUCKET(date_in_bucket, bucket_width)
```

```sql
DATE_BUCKET(date_in_bucket, bucket_width, bucket_origin_date)
```

**Description**

Gets the lower bound of the date bucket that contains a date.

**Definitions**

+   `date_in_bucket`: A `DATE` value that you can use to look up a date bucket.
+   `bucket_width`: An `INTERVAL` value that represents the width of
    a date bucket. A [single interval][interval-single] with
    [date parts][interval-parts] is supported.
+   `bucket_origin_date`: A `DATE` value that represents a point in time. All
    buckets expand left and right from this point. If this argument is not set,
    `1950-01-01` is used by default.

**Return type**

`DATE`

**Examples**

In the following example, the origin is omitted and the default origin,
`1950-01-01` is used. All buckets expand in both directions from the origin,
and the size of each bucket is two days. The lower bound of the bucket in
which `my_date` belongs is returned.

```sql
WITH some_dates AS (
  SELECT DATE '1949-12-29' AS my_date UNION ALL
  SELECT DATE '1949-12-30' UNION ALL
  SELECT DATE '1949-12-31' UNION ALL
  SELECT DATE '1950-01-01' UNION ALL
  SELECT DATE '1950-01-02' UNION ALL
  SELECT DATE '1950-01-03'
)
SELECT DATE_BUCKET(my_date, INTERVAL 2 DAY) AS bucket_lower_bound
FROM some_dates;

In the following example, the origin has been changed to `2000-12-24`,
and all buckets expand in both directions from this point. The size of each
bucket is seven days. The lower bound of the bucket in which `my_date` belongs
is returned:

### `DATETIME_BUCKET`

```sql
DATETIME_BUCKET(datetime_in_bucket, bucket_width)

**Description**

Gets the lower bound of the datetime bucket that contains a datetime.

**Definitions**

+   `datetime_in_bucket`: A `DATETIME` value that you can use to look up a
    datetime bucket.
+   `bucket_width`: An `INTERVAL` value that represents the width of
    a datetime bucket. A [single interval][interval-single] with
    [date and time parts][interval-parts] is supported.
+   `bucket_origin_datetime`: A `DATETIME` value that represents a point in
    time. All buckets expand left and right from this point. If this argument
    is not set, `1950-01-01 00:00:00` is used by default.

**Return type**

`DATETIME`

**Examples**

In the following example, the origin is omitted and the default origin,
`1950-01-01 00:00:00` is used. All buckets expand in both directions from the
origin, and the size of each bucket is 12 hours. The lower bound of the bucket

# Aggregate function calls

An aggregate function summarizes the rows of a group into a single value. When
an aggregate function is used with the `OVER` clause, it becomes a window
function, which computes values over a group of rows and then returns a single
result for each row.

## Aggregate function call syntax

```zetasql
function_name(
  [ DISTINCT ]
  function_arguments
  [ { IGNORE | RESPECT } NULLS ]
  [ HAVING { MAX | MIN } having_expression ]
  [ ORDER BY key [ { ASC | DESC } ] [, ... ] ]
  [ LIMIT n ]
)
[ OVER over_clause ]
```

**Description**

Each aggregate function supports all or a subset of the
aggregate function call syntax. You can use the following syntax to build an
aggregate function:

+ `DISTINCT`: Each distinct value of
  `expression` is aggregated only once into the result.
+ `IGNORE NULLS` or `RESPECT NULLS`: If `IGNORE NULLS` is
  specified, the `NULL` values are excluded from the result. If
  `RESPECT NULLS` is specified, both `NULL` and non-`NULL` values can be
  included in the result.

  If neither `IGNORE NULLS` nor `RESPECT NULLS` is specified, most functions
  default to `IGNORE NULLS` behavior but in a few cases `NULL` values are
  respected.
+ `HAVING MAX` or `HAVING MIN`: Restricts the set of rows that the
  function aggregates by a maximum or minimum value.
  For details, see [HAVING MAX and HAVING MIN clause][max_min_clause].
+ `ORDER BY`: Specifies the order of the values.

  +  For each sort key, the default sort direction is `ASC`.

  +  `NULL` is the minimum possible value, so `NULL`s appear first
     in `ASC` sorts and last in `DESC` sorts.

  +  If you're using floating point data types, see
     [Floating point semantics][floating-point-semantics]
     on ordering and grouping.

  +  The `ORDER BY` clause is supported only for aggregate functions that
     depend on the order of their input. For those functions, if the
     `ORDER BY` clause is omitted, the output is nondeterministic.

  + This `ORDER BY` clause can't be used if the `OVER` clause is used.

  +  If `DISTINCT` is also specified, then
     the sort key must be the same as `expression`.
+ `LIMIT`: Specifies the maximum number of `expression` inputs in the
  result.

  +  If the input is an `ARRAY` value, the limit applies to the number of input
     arrays, not the number of elements in the arrays. An empty array counts
     as `1`. A `NULL` array isn't counted.

  +  If the input is a `STRING` value, the limit applies to the number of input
     strings, not the number of characters or bytes in the inputs. An empty
     string counts as `1`. A `NULL` string isn't counted.

  + The limit `n` must be a constant `INT64`.
+ `OVER`: If the aggregate function is also a window function, use this clause
  to define a window of rows around the row being evaluated. For each row,
  the aggregate function result is computed using the selected window of rows as
  input. If this clause is used, aggregate function
  clauses (i.e.
  `DISTINCT`) can't be used. To learn more about the `OVER` clause,
  see [Window function calls][window-function-calls].

**Details**

The clauses in an aggregate function call are applied in the following order:

+ `OVER`
+ `DISTINCT`
+ `IGNORE NULLS` or `RESPECT NULLS`
+ `HAVING MAX` or `HAVING MIN`
+ `ORDER BY`
+ `LIMIT`
+ `CLAMPED BETWEEN`

When used in conjunction with a `GROUP BY` clause, the groups summarized
typically have at least one row. When the associated `SELECT` statement has
no `GROUP BY` clause or when certain aggregate function modifiers filter rows
from the group to be summarized, it's possible that the aggregate function
needs to summarize an empty group.

## Restrict aggregation by a maximum or minimum value 
<a id="max_min_clause"></a>

Some aggregate functions support two optional clauses that are called
`HAVING MAX` and `HAVING MIN`. These clauses restrict the set of rows that a
function aggregates to rows that have a maximum or minimum value in a particular
column.

### HAVING MAX clause 
<a id="having_max"></a>

```zetasql
HAVING MAX having_expression
```

`HAVING MAX` restricts the set of input rows that the function aggregates to
only those with the maximum `having_expression` value. The maximum value is
computed as the result of `MAX(having_expression)` across rows in the group.
Only rows whose `having_expression` value is equal to this maximum value (using
SQL equality semantics) are included in the aggregation. All other rows are
ignored in the aggregation.

This clause supports all [orderable data types][agg-data-type-properties],
except for `ARRAY`.

**Examples**

In the following query, rows with the most inches of precipitation, `4`, are
added to a group, and then the `year` for one of these rows is produced.
Which row is produced is nondeterministic, not random.

```zetasql
WITH
  Precipitation AS (
    SELECT 2009 AS year, 'spring' AS season, 3 AS inches
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2001, 'winter', 4
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2003, 'fall', 1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2002, 'spring', 4
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2005, 'summer', 1
  )
SELECT ANY_VALUE(year HAVING MAX inches) AS any_year_with_max_inches FROM Precipitation;

/*--------------------------*
 | any_year_with_max_inches |
 +--------------------------+
 | 2001                     |
 *--------------------------*/
```

In the following example, the average rainfall is returned for 2001, the most
recent year specified in the query. First, the query gets the rows with the
maximum value in the `year` column. Finally, the query averages the values in
the `inches` column (`9` and `1`):

```zetasql
WITH
  Precipitation AS (
    SELECT 2001 AS year, 'spring' AS season, 9 AS inches
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2001, 'winter', 1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2000, 'fall', 3
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2000, 'summer', 5
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2000, 'spring', 7
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2000, 'winter', 2
  )
SELECT AVG(inches HAVING MAX year) AS average FROM Precipitation;

/*---------*
 | average |
 +---------+
 | 5       |
 *---------*/
```

### HAVING MIN clause 
<a id="having_min"></a>

```zetasql
HAVING MIN having_expression
```

`HAVING MIN` restricts the set of input rows that the function aggregates to
only those with the minimum `having_expression` value. The minimum value is
computed as the result of `MIN(having_expression)` across rows in the group.
Only rows whose `having_expression` value is equal to this minimum value (using
SQL equality semantics) are included in the aggregation. All other rows are
ignored in the aggregation.

This clause supports all [orderable data types][agg-data-type-properties],
except for `ARRAY`.

**Examples**

In the following query, rows with the fewest inches of precipitation, `1`,
are added to a group, and then the `year` for one of these rows is produced.
Which row is produced is nondeterministic, not random.

```zetasql
WITH
  Precipitation AS (
    SELECT 2009 AS year, 'spring' AS season, 3 AS inches
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2001, 'winter', 4
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2003, 'fall', 1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2002, 'spring', 4
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2005, 'summer', 1
  )
SELECT ANY_VALUE(year HAVING MIN inches) AS any_year_with_min_inches FROM Precipitation;

/*--------------------------*
 | any_year_with_min_inches |
 +--------------------------+
 | 2003                     |
 *--------------------------*/
```

In the following example, the average rainfall is returned for 2000, the
earliest year specified in the query. First, the query gets the rows with
the minimum value in the `year` column, and finally, the query averages the
values in the `inches` column:

```zetasql
WITH
  Precipitation AS (
    SELECT 2001 AS year, 'spring' AS season, 9 AS inches
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2001, 'winter', 1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2000, 'fall', 3
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2000, 'summer', 5
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2000, 'spring', 7
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2000, 'winter', 2
  )
SELECT AVG(inches HAVING MIN year) AS average FROM Precipitation;

/*---------*
 | average |
 +---------+
 | 4.25    |
 *---------*/
```

## Aggregate function examples

A simple aggregate function call for `COUNT`, `MIN`, and `MAX` looks like this:

```zetasql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS total_count,
  COUNT(fruit) AS non_null_count,
  MIN(fruit) AS min,
  MAX(fruit) AS max
FROM
  (
    SELECT NULL AS fruit
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'apple' AS fruit
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'pear' AS fruit
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'orange' AS fruit
  )

/*-------------+----------------+-------+------*
 | total_count | non_null_count | min   | max  |
 +-------------+----------------+-------+------+
 | 4           | 3              | apple | pear |
 *-------------+----------------+-------+------*/
```

In the following example, the average of `x` over a specified window is returned
for each row. To learn more about windows and how to use them, see
[Window function calls][window-function-calls].

```zetasql
SELECT
  x,
  AVG(x) OVER (ORDER BY x ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS avg
FROM UNNEST([0, 2, 4, 4, 5]) AS x;

/*------+------*
 | x    | avg  |
 +------+------+
 | 0    | 0    |
 | 2    | 1    |
 | 4    | 3    |
 | 4    | 4    |
 | 5    | 4.5  |
 *------+------*/
```

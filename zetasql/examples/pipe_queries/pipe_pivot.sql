-- These are examples of pipe PIVOT and UNPIVOT operators.
-- They can be executed in `execute_query` with the `tpch` catalog.

-- PIVOT
--
-- This produces one column for each value listed in the IN, computing the
-- requested aggregate functions over the rows for that value.
--
-- More detail: Columns not mentioned in the PIVOT clause are grouping columns.
-- The FOR column is the source column to pivot from.  Output includes one row
-- for each group.  Output has the grouping columns, and then one column for each
-- value in the IN list, with the aggregate computed where the source column had
-- that value.
--
-- See
-- https://github.com/google/zetasql/blob/master/docs/pipe-syntax.md#pivot
-- for more details and options.

FROM Orders
|> SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o_orderdate) AS year, o_orderpriority, o_totalprice
|> PIVOT
     (
       COUNT(*) AS count,
       SUM(o_totalprice) AS price
           FOR o_orderpriority IN ('1-URGENT', '2-HIGH', '3-MEDIUM'));

-- UNPIVOT
--
-- For input rows with values in N columns, this produces N rows in a key/value
-- representation, with one row for each of the N columns.
--
-- More detail:
-- For each input row, this produces multiple output rows - one for each of
-- columns listed in IN.  The IN columns are removed and replaced by one column
-- (`animal` here), which indicates which source column this row came from.
-- The single `cnt` output column stores the values from each of the IN columns.

-- See
-- https://github.com/google/zetasql/blob/master/docs/pipe-syntax.md#unpivot
-- for more details and options.

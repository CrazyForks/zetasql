  // rewritten AST, and potentially other output properties, in the return
  // value.
  //
  // The rewriter must use pools and sequence numbers from 'options' to allocate
  // new columns and ids. Likewise, any new types must be allocated via
  // 'type_factory'.
  //
  // The rewriter may return an error if the rewrite fails. In general, a
  // rewriter should never do semantic validation of the query being rewritten.
  // There are some other cases that can result in errors returned.
  // kInvalidArgument errors are possible especially if a catalog object is
  //     invalid. Because semantic validation is always handled before
  //     rewriting, a KInvalidArgument typically is the fault of the query
  //     engine and are generally not interesting to the user.
  // kInternal errors typically mean a broken invariant and likely signal a bug
  //     in the rewriter or an unexpected input shape. This typically is the
  //     fault of the compiler library and is generally not interesting to the
  //     user.
  // kUnimplemented errors are likely for legal shapes that are not supported by
  //     the rewriter implementation. Presumably, if the engine enables the
  //     rewrite and the rewrite doesn't support a shape, the engine doesn't
  //     support that shape either. The user needs to see these errors so they
  //     can work around the unsupported shape.
